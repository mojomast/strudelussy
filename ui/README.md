# strudelussy UI

Frontend for the strudelussy DAW MVP.

Upstream credit: the editor/runtime foundation comes from [VoloBuilds/toaster](https://github.com/VoloBuilds/toaster), with strudelussy extending it through wrapper components and orchestration rather than replacing the core editor internals.

## What Is In This UI

- DAW-style three-column project page at `/` with two switchable modes:
  - **Ussy mode** — CSS Grid layout with resizable, collapsible panels, ussy design tokens, focus mode
  - **Legacy mode** — preserved original fixed three-column layout (toggle with `Cmd+Shift+L`)
- projects gallery at `/projects`
- diff-aware AI chat review flow
- streaming assistant responses with a live typing bubble
- Strudel editor + playback using the existing upstream editor/runtime
- parsed BPM, key, section, and per-track gain/pan metadata from current code
- guest-mode local project persistence
- version history refresh + restore panel
- preview/apply/reject AI patch flow with multiple pending diffs keyed per assistant message
- slim single-row topbar with settings drawer (4 tabs: AI Settings, Prompts, API, Export & Share), master volume slider, token usage pill, and optional custom chat provider override
- collapsible accordion DAW sidebar with localStorage-persisted section state (Mixer, Rhythm Generator, Arrange, FX Rack, Version History) and Collapse All / Expand All toggle
- rhythm generator with per-voice gain, arrange panel, FX rack with explicit on/off filter states, mutate toolbar, shortcut overlay
- focus mode (`Cmd+Shift+F`) hides topbar and both sidebars; floating toggle always visible
- panel toggle shortcuts (`[` for chat, `]` for DAW) with contenteditable/CodeMirror guard
- slim 44px transport bar with phase progress indicator, play pulse animation, and error status alerts
- resize handles on both chat and DAW panels with min/max width constraints and collapse-to-icon-rail
- lazy-loaded HAL visualization (code-split chunk) rendered inside the editor panel as a background layer
- ussy design system with `--ussy-*` CSS custom properties (electric teal accent, alpha-blended dividers, motion contract)
- full ARIA accessibility: tablist/tab/tabpanel in settings drawer, aria-labels on icon-only buttons, role=progressbar on phase bar, aria-expanded on accordion headers and settings toggle
- `ArrangePanel`, `FxRack`, `RhythmGenerator` wrapped in `React.memo` for render optimization
- stable `useCallback` references in DawPanel to prevent unnecessary child re-renders

```bash
pnpm install

## Notes

- The live UI should always expose a prominent `Source` link and `License` link because the deployed app includes AGPL-licensed Strudel-derived components.
- The repo-level disclosure note lives at `../docs/STRUDEL_SOURCE_DISCLOSURE.md`.
- Track mixer sliders patch per-track `gain()` and `pan()` calls live in the code and trigger a debounced re-evaluation while playback is active.
- Slider commits create version snapshots on pointer/key release when the code actually changed.
- AI previews can audition a proposed patch in the editor before Apply; Reject or Stop Preview restores the pre-preview snapshot.
- Empty or truncated streamed chat responses are retried once automatically before an error message is shown.
- The chat footer includes `Retry last` plus a `YOLO: auto-apply patches` toggle for immediate AI patch application.
- Older chat turns are summarized while recent ones stay verbatim, and the topbar shows an approximate token count for the current context window.
- The Ussy mode shell uses a CSS Grid three-column layout with resizable, collapsible sidebars. Both chat and DAW panels can be collapsed to 40px icon rails via chevron buttons or keyboard shortcuts (`[`/`]`).
- The Legacy mode shell preserves the original fixed three-column layout for comparison. Toggle between modes with `Cmd+Shift+L`.
- Focus mode (`Cmd+Shift+F`) hides the topbar and both sidebars, leaving only the editor and transport bar. A floating button is always visible to exit.
- HAL now renders inside the editor panel as a lazy-loaded background layer beneath the code, code-split into its own chunk (~8 KB).
- The topbar viz toggle can hide that background layer entirely without affecting editor or transport behavior.
- The DAW sidebar uses collapsible accordion sections with animated expand/collapse and localStorage-persisted open/close state.
- `ArrangePanel`, `FxRack`, and `RhythmGenerator` are wrapped in `React.memo`; DawPanel uses stable `useCallback` references to prevent unnecessary child re-renders.
- The `[` and `]` shortcuts are guarded against firing in text inputs, textareas, selects, and contenteditable elements (including CodeMirror's editor).
- The editor remains the upstream toaster Strudel editor; it was extended rather than replaced.
- `pnpm preview` is only the local Vite production preview, not the production hosting path.
- Public `strudel.ussyco.de` hosting should use a production build, not the Vite dev server.
- The DAW shell is intentionally designed around panel-local scrolling rather than document-level page scrolling.
- Chat requests default to `google/gemini-2.5-flash`, but users can provide a custom endpoint + API key override in the settings drawer.
- When a custom provider is configured, clicking `Load Models` populates the model selector from that provider's `/models` API.
- The settings drawer switches between a legacy toaster prompt and a stricter Strudelussy prompt tuned for full-code JSON responses and safer Strudel edits.
- Users can also append their own custom system prompt instructions from the Prompts tab without replacing the selected base prompt entirely.
- The custom prompt area starts with the baseline prompt template loaded, can swap to the improved template, and lets users save named prompt presets to localStorage for repeatable testing.
- The settings drawer is organized as a tabbed panel (AI Settings, Prompts, API, Export & Share) with full ARIA tab roles.
- The topbar master volume slider controls a shared gain stage in the Strudel audio output, so it affects live playback immediately without rewriting code.
- The editor now passes its live `AnalyserNode` through the orchestrator into `HalVisualization`, restoring audio-reactive HAL motion closer to toaster's feel.
- Share success now shows the generated URL in the right-side DAW panel and offers a `Copy link` action; failures show a warning instead of the old `Share failed` placeholder.
- Streaming chat updates are throttled/buffered and repeated identical Strudel warnings are suppressed so long responses put less pressure on the audio thread.
